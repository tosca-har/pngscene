# Communicating Material Culture Diversity by Creating 3D Online or Virtual Reality Scenes or Games with Three.js (Part 1)

## Kristine Hardy & Mathieu Leclerc

### This guide shows how to use the Three.js javascript library to create a website with 3D models to illustrate the diversity of the pottery technologies of communities in the Papua New Guinea area. Selecting a vessel model reveals information on the community and their ceramics. The website is also able to be viewed in Virtual Reality (VR) and can be the basis for a matching puzzle.

The use of interactive 3D models in websites enables examples of archaeological and historical material culture to be presented more effectively and has the potential to increase community engagement with the research. This ability can be further exploited by using WebXR to make the websites viewable in virtual reality (VR), with larger models with increased manipulability.   

There are several different ways fro creaters to make websites that include models, including game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine. However websites can also be made relatively easily using the Three.js Javascript library. This guide provides an example of making such a website.
